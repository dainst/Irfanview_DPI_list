    <h1>Irfanview DPI List</h1>
    <div style="text-align: center;">F. Buccellati -- 11 March 2024</div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Irfanview DPI List is a program that analyzes a folder or a series of subfolders containing
      images to determine their resolutions and dimensions, which are critical for
      assessing usability in various print and digital formats. It generates an Excel report
      that details these metrics for each image, aiding in the quality assurance process.</p>
    <h2>Goals &amp; Usefulness</h2>
    <p>This tool streamlines the process of checking image resolution and dimensions
      across a collection, providing a first step before manual inspection. By leveraging
      IrfanView's capabilities to generate image metadata and organizing this data into
      an informative Excel report, users can quickly identify images that meet their specific
      requirements for quality and suitability.</p>
    <h2>Excel Structure</h2>
    <p>The output of the program is an Excel workbook composed of three detailed sheets:</p>
    <h3>DAI-Zeitschriften</h3>
    <p>This sheet lists the essential metadata extracted from each image, such as file name,
      image type, resolution, dimensions in pixels, and print sizes in various units. It is designed
      for quick reference, and gives the DPI for each image according to the standard DAI journal measurements.</p>
    <h3>DAI-Reihen</h3>
    <p>Similar to DAI-Zeitschriften but tailored for the DAI book series, this sheet
      includes comprehensive metadata while focusing on specific print dimensions and
      resolutions for both A4 and Ãœberformat sizes.</p>
    <h3>Max+Interactive</h3>
    <p>This interactive sheet provides dynamic calculations of potential print sizes at
      2 different DPI settings, allowing users to see the
      corresponding print dimensions for each image. Also, it allows users to input a desired image width
      to determine the DPI of the image at that size.</p>
    <h2>Program Structure</h2>
    <p>The Irfanview DPI List script operates by executing several key steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It first checks the current version of the script against an online repository to ensure the user has the latest version.</li>
      <li>The script then identifies the path to the IrfanView executable, which is necessary to extract image metadata.</li>
      <li>Users can select a specific directory or a parent directory to analyze multiple image folders recursively.</li>
      <li>Using IrfanView's command-line interface, the script extracts detailed image metadata and compiles it into a text file.</li>
      <li>This metadata is then parsed and organized into an Excel workbook with three specialized sheets, offering various insights and data representations for the analyzed images.</li>
      <li>The program employs Python's openpyxl library to create and format the Excel report, ensuring that the data is clear, accurate, and useful for the end-user.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>The program does not replace the user's examination of the files. These should still be examined for resolution problems,
      such as low resolution images that have been interpolated to higher resolutions, or for other issues that may not be apparent from the metadata.
    Also, the program only examines the DPI on the X axis, so users should determine if the images are adequate or too large in the Y dimension.
    However, the program does give a warning if the DPI along the Y axis does not match the X axis.</p>
