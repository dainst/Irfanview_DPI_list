    <h1>Image Quality Checker</h1>
    <div style="text-align: center;">F. Buccellati -- 21.11.23</div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Image Quality Checker is a program that analyzes a folder containing
      images to determine if the resolution and dimensions of those images meets
      the requirements for usage in print publications and materials. By
      extracting technical metadata about each image and applying custom quality
      assessment formulas, the program generates an Excel report specifying
      which images pass or fail predefined quality criteria.</p>
    <h2>Goals &amp; Usefulness</h2>
    <p>Manually checking image resolutions and dimensions across a large set of
      images can be an extremely tedious and time consuming process. This
      automated tool eliminates the need to manually inspect and evaluate images
      one-by-one. By extracting resolution specifications and vital technical
      data using a robust CLI tool called IrfanView, and by leveraging the
      analysis capabilities of Excel, this program can assess hundreds or
      thousands of images almost instantly.</p>
    <h2>Excel Structure</h2>
    <p>The main output of the program is an Excel Workbook containing two sheets
      - one sheet presents all of the raw technical data extracted from
      IrfanView including dimensions, resolution, color space, EXIF information,
      and more. The second "interactive" sheet contains distilled information
      about each image pertaining to quality analysis, including file name,
      horizontal and vertical DPI resolution, width and height of the image in
      inches, and most importantly - a calculated Quality Coefficient.</p>
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>This Image Quality Checker delivers value to anyone preparing images for
      print publications and materials, such as photographers, graphic
      designers, scientists and researchers, marketing creators, book
      publishers, and more. Some examples of use cases are assessing images for
      magazine ads, analyzing figures for journal article submissions,
      evaluating photos for posters at academic conferences, or checking images
      as part of the book publishing workflow.</p>
    <h2>Quality Coefficient</h2>
    <p>To determine whether an image is high enough resolution for the intended
      use case, the program employs a Quality Coefficient formula to assign a
      score to each image. This coefficient combines the key metrics of DPI and
      dimensions into one numerical benchmark value that can be compared to
      acceptability thresholds. While proprietary image quality assessment
      algorithms do exist from companies like Adobe, this open Quality
      Coefficient formula allows full control over the criteria used to define
      what constitutes a "high quality" image on a customizable basis for each
      desired use case.</p>
    <h2>Program Structure</h2>
    <p>On a technical level, the core workflow of the Image Quality Checker code
      is: 1) Leverage the command line interface of IrfanView image viewer to
      batch extract image metadata like resolution DPI and dimensions into a
      temporary text file 2) Parse this text file using Python scripts to pull
      out the data needed for analysis 3) Perform Quality Coefficient
      calculations in Python on the dimensions and DPI numbers 3) Dynamically
      generate an Excel report containing raw data and results of quality checks
      based on custom thresholds using the openpyxl module in Python. The use of
      CLI tools, scripting, and office document generation offers fast,
      lightweight, portable automation for assessing image quality at scale.</p>
